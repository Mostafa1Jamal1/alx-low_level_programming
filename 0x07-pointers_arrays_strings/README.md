- Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
- The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s

1-memcpy.c  > is a source code for a function that copies memory area.
- Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
- The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
- Returns a pointer to dest
