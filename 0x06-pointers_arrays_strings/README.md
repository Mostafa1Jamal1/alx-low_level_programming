Let us start:

0-strcat.c > is a source code of a function that concatenates two strings.
- Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
- This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
- Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
