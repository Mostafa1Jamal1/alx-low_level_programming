_putchar > is a source code for a function that writes the character c to stdout.

main.h > is the header file for all the functions in this directory.

0-puts_recursion.c > is a source code for a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

1-print_rev_recursion.c > is a source code for a function that prints a string in reverse.
- Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

2-strlen_recursion.c > is a source code for a function that returns the length of a string.
- Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

3-factorial.c > is a source code for a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- Prototype: int factorial(int n);
- If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
- Factorial of 0 is 1

4-pow_recursion.c > is a source code for a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
- Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
- If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

5-sqrt_recursion.c > is a source code for a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
- Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
- If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
