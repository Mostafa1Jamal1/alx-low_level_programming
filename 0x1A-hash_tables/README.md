any file that is not mentioned here is for testing purposes.

Let us start:

`0-hash_table_create.c` -> source code file of a function that creates a hash table.
- Prototype: `hash_table_t *hash_table_create(unsigned long int size);`
- where `size` is the size of the array
- Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table
- If something went wrong, your function should return `NULL`
