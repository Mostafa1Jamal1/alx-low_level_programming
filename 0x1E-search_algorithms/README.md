Let us start:


`0-linear.c` -> a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

- Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the first index where `value` is located
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if `array` is NULL, your function must return `-1`
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value
