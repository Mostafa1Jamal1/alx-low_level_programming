# This is a description of all the files in this directory <0x04-more_functions_nested_loops> 
All this tasks are to ensure the understanding of the functions and nested loops in c

main.h > is a header file that contains all the prototypes of the functions created.

0-isupper.c > is a source code file of a function that checks for uppercase character.
- Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

1-isdigit.c > is a source code file of a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a digit
- Returns 0 otherwise

2-mul.c > is a source code file of a function that multiplies two integers.
- Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

3-print_numbers.c > is a source code file of a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

4-print_most_numbers.c > is a source code file of a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
- Do not print 2 and 4
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

5-more_numbers.c > is a source code file of a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
- You can only use _putchar three times in your code
